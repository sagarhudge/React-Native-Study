     - Great for performance testing, web scraping, and automation tasks.
     - Direct access to Chrome DevTools for advanced browser interactions.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited to Chromium-based browsers (not cross-browser).
     - Less feature-rich for E2E testing compared to Cypress and Playwright.

### 5. **TestCafe**
   - **Overview:** TestCafe is a modern E2E testing framework that runs on Node.js and supports any browser that runs JavaScript.
   - **Key Features:**
     - No need for WebDriver; uses a browser automation engine built into TestCafe.
     - Built-in concurrency and parallel test execution.
     - Supports testing on remote devices and cloud environments.
   - **Integration:** Supports major CI tools and cloud-based testing platforms like BrowserStack.
   - **Pros:**
     - Easy to set up with a simple API.
     - Provides built-in concurrency for faster test execution.
     - No dependencies on specific browser drivers.
   - **Cons:**
     - Slower compared to Cypress and Playwright for complex apps.
     - Limited ecosystem and community compared to Cypress and Selenium.
