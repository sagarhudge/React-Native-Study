A code review checklist helps ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Here's a comprehensive template that can be used during code reviews to verify that the code meets the required standards:

Code Review Checklist Template

1. Code Functionality

[ ] Does the code accomplish the intended task without errors?

[ ] Are edge cases and exceptions properly handled?

[ ] Are input validations and error handling implemented appropriately?

[ ] Are any changes backward-compatible if needed?

[ ] Are any dependencies updated or added correctly?


2. Code Readability and Style

[ ] Is the code easy to read and understand?

[ ] Are functions and variables named descriptively and consistently?

[ ] Is the code free of commented-out sections and unnecessary debug logs?

[ ] Are the code formatting standards (indentation, line spacing, braces) consistent?

[ ] Are code comments and documentation clear and useful, explaining complex logic or rationale?

[ ] Is there consistent use of language-specific conventions and patterns?


3. Code Structure and Design

[ ] Is the code modular, separating concerns and responsibilities appropriately?

[ ] Are functions/classes kept small and single-purpose (Single Responsibility Principle)?

[ ] Is code duplication avoided (e.g., common logic reused through utility functions)?

[ ] Are global variables minimized, and is the use of state well-managed?

[ ] Is the code structured to be extensible and maintainable?

[ ] Are appropriate design patterns (e.g., MVC, Singleton, Factory) used?


4. Performance Considerations

[ ] Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks or areas where the code can be optimized?

[ ] Are loops, recursive functions, and other iterative operations optimized to minimize overhead?

[ ] Is the code handling large data sets or expensive operations efficiently (e.g., using pagination, caching)?

[ ] Are any asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls) handled properly to prevent blocking the main thread?


5. Security Best Practices

[ ] Are sensitive data (e.g., API keys, credentials) handled securely and not exposed in the codebase?

[ ] Are input validations performed to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)?

[ ] Are appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented?

[ ] Is the use of external libraries safe, and are dependencies checked for known vulnerabilities?

[ ] Is data encrypted where necessary (e.g., network communication, sensitive storage)?


6. Testing and Test Coverage

[ ] Are unit tests included for new and modified code?

[ ] Are tests clear, and do they cover various cases, including edge cases?

[ ] Are integration and end-to-end tests present for testing complete user flows?

[ ] Is the code covered adequately with automated tests (e.g., aiming for at least 80% coverage)?

[ ] Do all tests pass without errors or warnings?


7. Documentation

[ ] Is the code properly documented with comments explaining non-obvious parts?

[ ] Is there relevant documentation for setting up, running, and testing the code (e.g., README, inline docs)?

[ ] Are API endpoints, parameters, and expected outputs documented?

[ ] Are any configuration or environment variables explained in the documentation?


8. Version Control and Commit Messages

[ ] Are commit messages descriptive and follow the team's guidelines (e.g., including JIRA ticket numbers)?

[ ] Is the code appropriately organized into logical commits (e.g., one feature or fix per commit)?

[ ] Are unnecessary files (e.g., logs, temporary files) excluded from commits?


9. Compliance with Architecture and Guidelines

[ ] Does the code follow the team's architectural patterns and standards?

[ ] Are there any architectural improvements or refactors needed for scalability or maintainability?

[ ] Does the code comply with coding guidelines (e.g., linting rules, style guides)?

[ ] Are environment-specific configurations separated from the codebase (e.g., using environment variables)?


Optional Checks (If Applicable)

10. Accessibility

[ ] Does the code follow accessibility best practices (e.g., screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation)?

[ ] Are ARIA attributes and semantic HTML used appropriately where applicable?


11. Localization/Internationalization (i18n)

[ ] Are strings and UI texts properly localized?

[ ] Are date/time formats, number formats, and currencies adaptable based on locale?


12. API and Backend Integration

[ ] Are API calls implemented efficiently (e.g., with caching or pagination where needed)?

[ ] Are response data and errors handled properly (e.g., fallback behavior, retries)?

[ ] Are appropriate HTTP methods and status codes used?


Conclusion

A code review checklist ensures consistency, quality, and maintainability across a codebase. It helps catch errors early, maintain standards, and support team collaboration by providing a structured approach to reviewing code.
